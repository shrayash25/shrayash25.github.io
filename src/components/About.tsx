            I'm a software engineer passionate about building efficient and scalable solutions that make a real impact. 
            With experience in full-stack development, ML, and blockchain, I focus on creating user-friendly applications 
            that solve meaningful problems. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, writing clean and maintainable code, and 
            continuously learning to improve my craft. I also dabble in competitive programming, which helps me sharpen my 
            problem-solving skills and think more algorithmically.
